# This is me messing around

- Take this whole thing with a grain of salt!
- I wrote it because I finally coughed up and bought TextMate and wanted to test out TM2.
- If you're still reading...

##About
Aushi is a simple blog-like ... well I suppose CMS could be an appropriate term. It takes flat files in a data directory and mangles th.. I mean, pretends they're pages or posts. I've got some figuring out, since I half want to differentiate between the two. We shall see. Right now, the first line of .page files are interpreted as the title of the page and the rest the body.

##Install
Just put the files in a dir apache can read and play with the values near the top of `config.php`.

##Future Plans

- Markdown. Duh.
- Image support.
- Post editor/admincpishthingy
- Sleep.
